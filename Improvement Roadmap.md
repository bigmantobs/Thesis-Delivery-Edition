## Current System-Roadmap
1. Build backend using SpringBOOT such that a full stack system can be supported. ✅
	1. Will drop the compilation errors that arise with current prototype.
3. Develop own parser for translating the BPMN files to alloy/other files. ✅
	1. This will allow the backend to be 100% own code, making it more clear what work is done by me.
	2. Furthermore, dropping the Camunda API and rebuilding the backend will make it easier to build a full stack system.
4. Expand upon the capabilities of the Alloy implementation. (partial)✅
	1. This will mostly serve to answer the question of to which extent BPMN elements can be represented in Alloy, as unfortunately large models will likely still not run in an acceptable runtime.
5. Develop a shell for the front-end (super basic, aesthetics can be fixed later) ✅
6. Add more modelling languages to which the BPMN model will be translated.
	1. This will allow for the testing of some non "toy examples".
	2. Example languages: OCL, FOML, Maude.
	3. Ask Adrian for more potential languages to add.
7. Add feature for users to put in process requests.
## Current Paper-Roadmap
1. Proofread and fix chapters 1 and 2.
	1. Should be fast, as these only had minor errors.
2. Through feedback, fix chapter 3.
	1. This chapter is ill-written, even though it is not mentioned by name.
3. Add a research method section
	1.  Elaborate on how the research questions will be answered
	2. Things to include:  Research ethics, Own role, Requirements to be valid information, What factors impacts the inclusion of references, expand on what a conceptualization is.
4. Rewrite design and implementation portion, after further developments are made to the system.
	1. Emphasis here on clarifying EVERYTHING.
	2. Evt. Split up this portion based on which implementation is being discussed, once more languages are supported. 
5. Test more realistic models, even if the results are undesirable.
	1. Avoid "toy examples"
6. Rewrite Analysis/Conclusion portion, with the results from the revamped system.
	1. Don't make any statements without backing up with reasoning/evidence, and don't show figures without referencing to them in the text.
7. Rewrite related works, only include works which are actually related and link them somehow to the information brought forth in this thesis.
8. Proofread, proofread, proofread!
	1. The thesis should be professional, and having glaring mistakes literally ruins that aspect.
	2. If the proofreading is overwhelming --> break it down and go bit by bit.
